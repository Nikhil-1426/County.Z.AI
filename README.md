This is a **Flutter** application that detects and counts pipes in an image using a **Flask** backend with a **YOLOv8** model. The app allows users to upload an image, processes it on the backend, and returns the image with detected pipes along with the pipe count.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- Upload an image from the gallery or camera.
- Sends the image to a **Flask** backend for pipe detection.
- Receives a processed image with pipes mapped.
- Displays the **number of detected pipes**.
- Fast processing with **YOLOv8**.
